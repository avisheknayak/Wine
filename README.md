# Wine
Detection of wine quality  using linear regression and logistic regression algorithms in machine learning.
We collect the data which consists of the various deciding factors for the quality of wine.In our project we mainly used two algorithms 
1)Linear-Regression and 2)Logistic Regression.
In the initial phase of the project we plot the data into distplts which consists of the various attributes /parameters to be tgaken in 
consideration .We infer that the data is quite good and normally distributed about the median.So we are good to go ahead for
the model training...
We may use other algorithms as er our need for more classification.
